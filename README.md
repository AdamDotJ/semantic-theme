# Semantic Wordpress Theme

This repository holds a Wordpress block theme dedicated to Movies, TV Shows and Music. Although at this exact moment I might decide to make a different more dedicated music theme. The fundamental goal of this theme is to make a semantic database of Movie & Tv Show information, another TVDB if you will. But with schema.org markup and user contributions and ways to try and verify and keep the information as accurate as possible.

More details to come...
